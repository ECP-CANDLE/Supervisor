Two test cases to broadcast a file to /dev/shm on all compute nodes.
Both cases run the same Swift workflow (!), they just use different external settings
to move the data.

== sbcast

Usage:
----
$ ./sbcast-1.sh
----

Inserts an `sbcast` command into the `turbine-slurm.sh` script for execution
just before the workflow starts.  Does this via `TURBINE_PRELAUNCH`
https://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/sites.html#turbine_prelaunch[(manual)].

== MPI-IO

Usage:
----
$ ./mpi-io.sh
----

Uses a Turbine leader hook
http://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html#hooks[(manual)]
to use MPI-IO to make the file copy.
