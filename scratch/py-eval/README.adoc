= Simple C-Python Example

The program is called py-eval.  Its arguments are:

1. Zero or more Python scripts that are executed with no return value.
2. Any number of hyphen tokens - , which provides a _New Python Interpreter_ at each point.
3. The last argument must be:
.. Exactly one Python script that returns a string, which is printed, +
   or
.. the token "0" (zero), which prints nothing.

This has been tested with Python 2.7.10 and Python 3.6m.

For more verbose output, provide -v .

You may need to set environment variable PYTHONHOME at runtime to agree with PYTHON_HOME in the Makefile.

To enable MPI, edit the Makefile to set MPI=1 .

Transcript:
----
# edit Makefile for Python installation settings
$ make
$ export PYTHONHOME=...
$ ./py-eval py/import-io.py py/hello.py
----

To test the exception handling capabilities, do:
----
$ ./py-eval py/err.py py/hello.py
----

To test the _New Python Interpreter_ feature, compare:
----
$ cd py
$ ../py-eval x2.py print_x.py hello.py
2
'Hello'
----

with the same thing with added - :

----
$ cd py
$ ../py-eval x2.py - print_x.py hello.py

PYTHON EXCEPTION:
<class 'NameError'>
name 'x' is not defined
py-eval: python code failed.
