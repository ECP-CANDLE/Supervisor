= C interface for the Horovod API

The goal here is to provide a simple C interface that accepts a communicator and a fragment of Python code that will run Horovod.  An overarching C framework could thus create many communicators and run many Horovods on them.

The communicator that Horovod should use is passed from the C level to the Python level through an environment variable.

The module that connect C to Python is called the Controller.

== Usage

Edit the Makefile to configure your system.

== Tests

+test-1.c+::
Test that the Makefile and C compiler work.

+test-2.c+::
Test that you can +#include+ the Controller.

+test-3.c+::
Test that MPI works in C.

+test-4.c+::
Test that the Controller can run Python from C.

+test-5.c+::
Test that you can initialize Horovod from C.
Pass this a file containing the Python code you want to run,
e.g., test-5-1.py .
