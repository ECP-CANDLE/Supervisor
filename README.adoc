# Running the feature domain based comparison

- Create the CANDLE_DATA_DIR. Place drug_features.csv in the CANDLE_DATA_DIR
- The paths of the model's directories have to be added to the PYTHONPATH in workflow.sh
- Start the run using the command ./test-small-1.sh SITE, where SITE is the name of the computing system. test-small-1.sh is at workflows/cmp-cv/test
- upf-1.txt is used as the input file to specify the model hyperparameters as well as the model name and candle_image location.

```
{"id": "RUN000", "epochs": 1, "model_name": "DrugCell", "candle_image": "/path/to/sif/DrugCell.sif"}
{"id": "RUN001", "epochs": 2, "model_name": "DrugCell", "candle_image": "/path/to/sif/DrugCell.sif"}
{"id": "RUN002", "epochs": 1, "model_name": "SWnet_CCLE", "candle_image": "/path/to/sif/SWnet.sif"}
{"id": "RUN003", "epochs": 2, "model_name": "SWnet_CCLE", "candle_image": "/path/to/sif/SWnet.sif"}
```


#### Known issues

- some input files required for analysis have to be manually added to candle data dir
- outputs get written to 'experiments' not CANDLE_DATA_DIR
- python paths have to be explicitly specified in workflow.sh
- singularity container is not being used even though the CANDLE_MODEL_TYPE=SINGULARITY is specified
