= P2B1 with mlrMBO 

== Setup

Make sure you are using the correct Python.

. On Cori:
+
----
$ module load deeplearning
----
+
. Install https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor/blob/master/workflows/p2b1_mlrMBO/ext/EQ-R/eqr/cori_build.sh[EQ/R]
. Ensure you have OpenCV.
+
----
$ python
>> import cv2
----
+
If not, you can do:
+
----
$ pip install --user opencv-python
----
+
(This was tested on Cori with module +deeplearning+.)

== Download the data

Do this by running a test on the login node:
----
$ nice workflows/p2b1_mlrMBO/python/test/run_test.sh
----

This should download the data and start training, kill it after you can see it working.
