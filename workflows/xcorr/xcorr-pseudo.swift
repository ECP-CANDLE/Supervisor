for study 1 in set of studies
  for study 2 in set of studies
    if study 1 not equal study 2
      compute correlations

Selected features = best N features between A and B based on correlation

compute correlations:
  compute feature cross correlation matrix in study 1
  compute feature cross correlation matrix in study 2
  compute feature correlation between study 1 and study 2
