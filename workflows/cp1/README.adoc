= Mini Challenge Problem workflow

Currently, this uses a mix of xcorr and cp1.

== Quick Start

Run the workflow in +workflows/cp1+

=== Data

----
$ wget http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wozniak/candle-cp1-data.tgz
$ tar xfz candle-cp1-data.tgz
----

This will create a directory called xcorr_data

=== Execution

----
$ cd test
# edit cfg-* as necessary
$ ./test-1.sh theta -a
----

=== Doing a small run

. Edit data/studies[12].txt to select two different studies (one pair)
. Edit your cfg-sys file to set TURBINE_RESIDENT_WORK_WORKERS to the number of pairs


=== Summit Notes

Summit's project directories (e.g. /ccs/proj/med106/) are not writable from the compute nodes.
The workflow needs the following directories in Supervisor/workflows/cp1 to be writable.

* cache
* experiments
* xcorr_data

One solution is to symlink them from a writable location such as /gpfs/alpine/med106/scratch.
For example,

----
$ pwd
/ccs/proj/med106/ncollier/repos/Supervisor/workflows/cp1
$ ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ncollier ncollier   46 Mar  1 10:35 cache -> /gpfs/alpine/med106/scratch/ncollier/uno_cache
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ncollier ncollier   48 Feb 28 16:51 experiments -> /gpfs/alpine/med106/scratch/ncollier/experiments
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ncollier ncollier   47 Mar  1 12:38 xcorr_data -> /gpfs/alpine/med106/scratch/ncollier/xcorr_data
----
