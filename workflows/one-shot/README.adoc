This is a single one-shot combination of Swift/T and NT3 for use in evaluating data management strategies.

This is currently only set up for Theta.

== Setup

* Clone
+
----
$ cd /WORK/DIR
$ git clone https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Benchmarks.git
$ cd Benchmarks
$ git checkout develop
$ cd /WORK/DIR
$ git clone https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor.git
$ cd Supervisor
$ git checkout develop
----
* Get the data manually (prevent FTP transfer)
+
----
$ mkdir -p /WORK/DIR/Benchmarks/Data/Pilot1
$ cp ~/../wozniak/Public/data/nt*.csv /WORK/DIR/Benchmarks/Data/Pilot1
----
* Add the +swift-t+ from +env-theta.sh+ to your PATH, or use your own.
* Edit the modules in +run-nt3.sh+ as necessary.
* Edit the modules in +workflow.sh+ as necessary.

== Test NT3 without Swift/T

----
$ ./submit.sh
----

This submits +job.sh+, which runs +aprun+ on +run-nt3.sh+ . +
The output goes into +./output.txt+ ; the old output.txt is backed up.

== Run NT3 with Swift/T

----
$ ./workflow.sh
----

This runs +workflow.swift+, which runs +run-nt3.sh+ once. +
The output goes into a newly created +out-*/output.txt+ for each run.

== Finding the model output

In +Benchmarks/Pilot1/NT3/nt3_baseline_keras2.py+ , turn on the call to:

----
model.save_weights("{}/{}.weights.h5", ...)
----
