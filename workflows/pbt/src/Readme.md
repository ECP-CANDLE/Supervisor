# PBT src folder

This folder contains experimental c source code for using Dataspaces (http://personal.cac.rutgers.edu/TASSL/projects/data/index.html) as the PBT
datastore, i.e. where the weights and model metadata are stored for querying by other models.

This code is not necessary for running the file-based PBT example.
